Module 5 - Matplotlib challenge
# Pymaceuticals, Inc.

For this challenge, I used python coding, Pandas DataFrames, and Matplotlib to create all tables and figures using the datasets in [Mouse_metadata.csv](https://github.com/rperez025/matplotlib-challenge/blob/main/Pymaceuticals/data/Mouse_metadata.csv) and [Study_results.csv](https://github.com/rperez025/matplotlib-challenge/blob/main/Pymaceuticals/data/Study_results.csv). 

I completed the following tasks of the assignment:
* Prepared the data
* Generated summary statistics
* Created bar charts and pie charts
* Calculated quartiles, searched/found outliers, and created a box plot
* Created a line plot and scatter plot
* Calculated correlation and regression
* Submitted my final analysis

Please refer to "pymaceuticals_starter_RP.ipynb" for Output Results of coding and final analysis at: [LINK](https://github.com/rperez025/matplotlib-challenge/blob/main/Pymaceuticals/pymaceuticals_starter_RP.ipynb)

**RESOURCES AND REFERENCES**
During the challenge I referenced the following to aid in the understanding and completion of the assignment:

1. Reviewed all the class activites in GitLab Working Folder - reperforming a majority of them

2. Watched the following Dr. A instructor videos:
   * [Matplotlib Day 01 - Activity #13 - Average Rainfall with Pandas](https://youtu.be/OaGRhuT6r2o)
   * [Matplotlib Day 01 - Activity #12 - Scatter Py Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY2sMpqpxEE)
   * [Matplotlib Day 03 - Activity #06 - Correlation in Datasets](https://youtu.be/qWBzBhiB7RA)
   * [Matplotlib Day 03 - Activity #08 - Intro to Regression](https://youtu.be/_3ZYCbP6QZE)

3. I also performed additional online research to gain more understanding of the following topics:
   * [Standard Error of the Mean](https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/standard-error-mean/)
   * [Interquartile Range and Quartile Deviation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interquartile-range-and-quartile-deviation-using-numpy-and-scipy/)
   * [How to adjust markers in box plots](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43342564/flier-colors-in-boxplot-with-matplotlib)

4. I also used the following code as reference for performing my assignment. Specifically, I would review the code and gain an understanding of its organization and use. I would then take that understanding and incorporate my knowledge and practice from the class activities and instructor videos to write my script included "pymaceuticals_starter_RP.ipynb".
